We discuss Lex’s recent trip to the heart of the Ukrainian-Russian War, geopolitics, perspectives on people living in war zones, the shared human experience, and how information is communicated and controlled. As an experienced podcaster and public educator, Dr. Fridman offers unique insights into the art of holding conversations that grow understanding, especially when they involve people with opposing viewpoints. We also discuss the peer-review process for scientific research publications and how social media and podcasts are evolving the way science and technology are communicated. We consider how to find and follow your life’s purpose, maintain ongoing motivation and implement support systems to build and sustain momentum. Our conversation also covers capitalism, masculinity, chess and cheating, Lex’s idea for an AI robotics start-up and a Q&A from audience questions solicited on social media. As one of the main inspirations for the Huberman Lab podcast, hosting Dr. Fridman for this special centennial episode was an honor and a pleasure!\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAthletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Lex Fridman\n(00:04:46) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:28) Podcasting\n(00:12:11) Ukraine, Russia, War & Geopolitics\n(00:23:17) Conflict & Generalized Hate\n(00:26:23) Typical Day in Ukraine; American Military & Information Wars\n(00:36:56) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:38:42) Deliberate Cold Exposure & Sauna; Fertility\n(00:46:44) Ukraine: Science, Infrastructure & Military; Zelensky\n(00:53:33) Firearms; Violence & Sensitization\n(00:57:40) MIT & Artificial Intelligence (AI), University Teaching & Pandemic\n(01:05:51) Publications & Peer Review, Research, Social Media\n(01:13:05) InsideTracker\n(01:14:17) Twitter & Social Media Mindset, Andrew Tate & Masculinity\n(01:26:05) Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes\n(01:35:11) Biotechnology & Biopharma; Money & Status\n(01:45:08) Robotics, AI & Social Media; Start-ups\n(01:53:50) Motivation & Competition; Relationships\n(02:01:55) Jobs; A Career vs. A Calling; Robotics & Relationships\n(02:12:11) Chess, Poker & Cheating\n(02:22:25) Ideas of Lately\n(02:24:44) Why Lex Wears a Suit & Tie\n(02:27:50) Is There an AI Equivalent of Psychedelics? \n(02:29:06) Hardest Jiu-Jitsu Belt to Achieve\n(02:32:07) Advice to Young People\n(02:39:29) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss Tim’s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery — themes that have spanned his career that have placed him on the cutting-edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery, how to find and work with mentors, the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim’s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners, as Tim’s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts.

We cover macronutrient guidelines, when to eat relative to training and training fasted versus fed. Dr. Galpin describes proper hydration for before and during exercise, how dehydration and/or low electrolyte concentrations impede physical and mental performance.

      "description": "In this episode, I provide science-based tools and protocols to improve mood and mental health. These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the “Big 6” core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being. Then, I explain science-based tools to directly increase confidence, build a stronger concept of self, better understand our unconscious mind, manage stress and improve our emotional tone and processing. I also explain ways to better process negative emotions and traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone wishing to improve their relationship with themselves and others, elevate their mood and mental health, and better contribute to the world in meaningful ways.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nPlunge: https://plunge.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Mood & Mental Health Toolkit\n(00:03:10) Sponsors: Plunge, Eight Sleep & Waking Up\n(00:05:35) First Principles of Self-Care & 6 Pillars of Mental Health\n(00:13:58) Pillar #1: Sleep & Sleep Routine\n(00:18:00) Pillar #2: Light, Sunlight\n(00:24:38) Tool: Nighttime Environment & Darkness\n(00:28:33) Pillar #3: Movement; Pillar #4: Nutrition\n(00:33:18) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:51) Pillar #5: Social Connection\n(00:40:00) Pillar #6: Stress Control; Physiological Sigh\n(00:45:40) Tool: Raise Stress Threshold, Deliberate Cold Exposure\n(00:50:00) 6 Pillars & Brain Predictability, Affect & Emotion\n(00:57:58) Pharmacology, Psychedelics, Supplements & Neuroplasticity\n(01:06:25) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:07:26) Tool: Emotional Granularity\n(01:14:39) Tool: Heart Rate Variability & Emotional Graduality; Physiological Sigh\n(01:23:49) Tool: Unconscious Mind\n(01:26:54) Tool: Self-Concept, Self-Narrative Exercise\n(01:34:34) Tool: Unconscious Mind & Dream Analysis; Liminal States\n(01:42:52) Tool: Journaling; Generative Drive\n(01:52:43) Tool: Processing Trauma\n(02:00:43) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, my guest is Nolan Williams, M.D., a triple board-certified psychiatrist, neurologist and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams’ work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams’ knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n(00:03:48) Sponsors: LMNT\n(00:09:16) Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n(00:15:11) The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n(00:17:51) Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n(00:22:34) Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n(00:33:02) Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n(00:35:30) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:39:00) Belief/Identity “Rules”, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n(00:45:49) Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n(00:48:36) Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia\n(00:54:27) Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience or Biology?\n(01:03:42) SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance or Circuit?\n(01:13:58) Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution\n(01:21:00) MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin & Depression Treatment\n(01:24:12) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin\n(01:30:38) Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment\n(01:34:53) Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment\n(01:41:23) Normal Spectrums for Mental Health Disorders\n(01:45:35) Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials\n(01:57:16) Clinical Use of Psychedelics\n(02:01:59) Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study\n(02:06:55) Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses\n(02:14:52) Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol\n(02:20:42) Circadian Reset for Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light\n(02:28:43) Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study\n(02:34:25) Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation\n(02:45:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "This episode teaches you a lot about the immune system, immune-brain interactions and offers 12 potential tools for enhancing immune system function. I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.\nI discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic \"washout\" of brain debris during sleep. I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) The Mind & Immune System, New Findings: Acupuncture & Fascia\n(00:03:16) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:07:41) Foundational Tools & Practices for a Healthy Immune System\n(00:11:20) Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System\n(00:17:08) Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (“Eat Me!” Signals), Cytokines (“Help Me!” Signals)\n(00:21:06) The Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies\n(00:28:00) Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome and “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing\n(00:30:33) Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Your Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods\n(00:34:20) Some Interleukins Are Anti-Inflammatory\n(00:34:56) Sickness Behavior\n(00:39:08) Some People Seek Care When Sick, Others Want to be Alone\n(00:42:00) Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines\n(00:43:40) Reduced Appetites When Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido\n(00:46:45) Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness\n(00:53:03) Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Your Brain State\n(00:55:04) Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin, 5HTP\n(01:07:03) Tool 6: Hot Showers, Saunas, Baths & Cortisol, Heath-Cold Contrast\n(01:10:53) Feed a Fever & Starve a Cold (?), Adrenaline\n(01:12:36) Tool 7: Activating Your Immune System w/Cyclic-Hyperventilation, Alkalinity\n(01:29:10) Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine\n(01:32:10) Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, You Can Worry Yourself Sick\n(01:37:00) Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold Exposure\n(01:42:05) Once You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis\n(01:46:09) Histamines, Mast Cells\n(01:49:22) Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism for How It Reduces Inflammation; Fascia, Rolfing \n(01:53:40) Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices\n(01:58:00) Synthesis, Ways to Support Us (Zero-Cost), Sponsors, Supplements, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this journal club episode, my guest is Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician, Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who is also the host of The Drive podcast and the author of the bestselling book \"Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity.\"\nWe each present a scientific paper and discuss the findings' strengths, weaknesses and actionable takeaways.\nFirst, we discuss an article that addresses whether taking the drug metformin can enhance longevity. Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one's belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose.\nOur conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.

      "description": "In this episode, I explain how medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse and other stimulants work to increase focus and treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use. This episode ought to benefit anyone with ADHD, their parents, those on ADHD medications or anyone curious about how these medications work.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nThe Brain Body Contract\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Stimulants & Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\n(00:03:38) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:06:35) The Brain-Body Contract\n(00:07:22) Attention, Prefrontal Cortex & ADHD\n(00:16:27) Stimulants “Sympathomimetics”\n(00:21:29) Adderall, Dopamine & Norepinephrine\n(00:25:58) Sympathomimetics, Dopamine & Norepinephrine\n(00:27:21) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:32:20) Vyvanse is Timed-Release D-Amp\n(00:36:36) Ritalin, Concerta\n(00:40:10) Dopamine & “Noise Reduction”; Norepinephrine & “Signal Amplification”\n(00:45:28) ADHD: Focus, Hyperactivity & Impulsivity; Drug Selection & Dose\n(00:50:57) How do Stimulants ‘Calm’ ADHD?\n(00:54:480 Neuroplasticity & Neuromodulators\n(00:58:06) Kids, ADHD Diagnosis & Treatment; Predispose Addiction?\n(01:05:12) ADHD Medications: Individuality, Doses, Tapering & Long-Term Use\n(01:13:28) Medication & Long-Term Effects: Height, Cardiovascular Risk, Alcohol\n(01:19:32) Cortisol & Hormones\n(01:27:45) Psychosis & Addiction; Methamphetamine\n(01:38:20) Recreational Use, Addiction & Psychosis; Habituation\n(01:42:30) Drug Holidays; Ritalin & Long-Term Effects\n(01:45:35) Modafinil, Armodafinil; Side-Effects\n(01:53:03) Guanfacine, Alcohol\n(01:58:03) ADHD Medications\n(02:00:26) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:00:32) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:05:10) Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link\n(00:07:40) Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable\n(00:10:53) To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy & Puberty\n(00:15:21) Your First Feeling Was Anxiety\n(00:17:36) What Are “Healthy Emotions”?\n(00:19:03) Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App\n(00:21:08) The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself\n(00:24:00) You Are An Infant: Bonds & Predictions\n(00:27:57) Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment\n(00:32:40) “Glue Points” Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)\n(00:36:34) “Emotional Health”: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic\n(00:37:50) An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias\n(00:42:19) Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture\n(00:46:59) Puberty: Biology & Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive\n(00:47:58) Bodyfat & Puberty: The Leptin Connection\n(00:50:34) Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage\n(00:54:37) Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent\n(00:58:26) Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists & Testing Emotional Bonds\n(01:00:25) Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal\n(01:07:48) Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet\n(01:11:05) “Right-Brain Versus Left-Brain People”: Facts Versus Lies\n(01:14:18) Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness\n(01:16:15) How To Recognize “Right Brain Activity” In Speech: Prosody\n(01:18:32) Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States\n(01:20:09) Mirror Neurons: Are Not For “Empathy”, Maybe For Predicting Behavior\n(01:23:00) Promoting Trust & Monogamy\n(01:27:00) Ways To Increase Oxytocin\n(01:28:34) Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities\n(01:30:43) Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body\n(01:35:18) A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range & Depth of Emotional Experience\n(01:30:43) MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework\n(01:38:54) Roundup, Various Forms of Support\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit.

      "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Buss, Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, and one of the founding members of the field of evolutionary psychology.\nDr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship, and mate value assessment — meaning how people measure up as potential partners. We also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people’s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And we discuss what Dr. Buss calls “the dark triad”— features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.\nThis episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introducing Dr. David Buss\n(00:04:27) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:33) Choosing a Mate\n(00:13:40) Long Term Mates: Universal Desires\n(00:18:31) What Women & Men Seek in Long-Term Mates\n(00:25:10) Age Differences & Mating History \n(00:32:20) Deception in Courtship\n(00:37:30) Emotional Stability\n(00:38:40) Lying About Long-Term Interest\n(00:41:56) Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects\n(00:46:25) Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching\n(00:54:25) Genetic Cuckolds, How Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference\n(00:57:00) Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment\n(00:59:15) Emotional & Financial Infidelity\n(01:04:35) Contraception \n(01:06:22) Status & Mating Success\n(01:10:10) Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence\n(01:24:13) Specificity of Intimate Partner Violence  \n(01:25:12) Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.\n(01:27:33) Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy\n(01:33:25) Stalking\n(01:39:15) Influence of Children on Mate Value Assessments \n(01:43:24) Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity\n(01:46:40) Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships  \n(01:54:00) Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety About the Truth\n(02:02:12) Self Deception\n(02:05:35) The Future of Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience  \n(02:06:56) Books: When Men Behave Badly; The Evolution of Desire, Textbooks\n(02:10:42) Concluding Statements, Zero-Cost Support: Subscribe, Sponsors, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "This episode I explain the science of heating and cooling the body, a process called thermoregulation-- and how to apply that knowledge to significantly improve physical performance. I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives. Finally, I discuss the temperature-effects of caffeine, alcohol and anti-inflammatory compounds.

      "description": "In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his lab’s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (“olfaction”) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of “social sensing” and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab’s work on digitization of smell — which may soon allow online communication to include “sending of odors” via the internet. Dr. Sobel’s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Noam Sobel\n(00:04:03) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:06:46) Olfaction Circuits (Smell)\n(00:14:49) Loss & Regeneration of Smell, Illness\n(00:21:39) Brain Processing of Smell\n(00:24:40) Smell & Memories\n(00:25:11) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:29:07) Humans & Odor Tracking\n(00:39:25) The Alternating Nasal Cycle & Autonomic Nervous System\n(00:48:18) Cognitive Processing & Breathing\n(00:54:47) Neurodegenerative Diseases & Olfaction\n(01:00:12) Congenital Anosmia\n(01:06:19) Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals & Social Sensing\n(01:15:07) Smelling Ourselves & Smelling Others\n(01:22:02) Odors & Romantic Attraction\n(01:24:58) Vomeronasal Organ, “Bruce Effect” & Miscarriage\n(01:40:20) Social Chemo-Signals, Fear\n(01:50:26) Chemo-Signaling, Aggression & Offspring\n(02:03:57) Menstrual Cycle Synchronization\n(02:12:11) Sweat, Tears, Emotions & Testosterone\n(02:27:46) Science Politics\n(02:37:54) Food Odors & Nutritional Value\n(02:45:34) Human Perception & Odorant Similarity\n(02:52:12) Digitizing Smell, COVID-19 & Smell\n(03:05:50) Medical Diagnostic Future & Olfaction Digitization\n(03:10:55) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, I discuss the physiological effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain and body at different levels of consumption and over time. I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Effects of Alcohol Consumption\n(00:03:19) Low to Moderate Alcohol Consumption & Neurodegeneration \n(00:06:14) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:10:46) Historical Context & Uses of Alcohol \n(00:13:28) Alcohol Metabolism, “Empty Calories” \n(00:18:23) Inebriation: Top-Down Inhibition, Impulsivity & Memory Formation\n(00:24:23) Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility \n(00:27:55) Food & Alcohol Absorption\n(00:30:07) Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk for Alcoholism, Blackouts\n(00:37:39) Predisposition for Alcoholism; Chronic Consumption, Cortisol & Stress\n(00:43:29) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:46:07) Genetic Predisposition for Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Too Young\n(00:52:27) Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Alcohol, Gut Microbiome, Inflammation & Leaky Gut \n(00:59:46) Tool: Improving/Replenishing Gut Microbiome \n(01:02:44) Reducing Alcohol Consumption & Stress \n(01:04:25) Hangover: Alcohol & Sleep, Anxiety, Headache\n(01:12:11) Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure \n(01:17:16) Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes\n(01:20:45) Types of Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners  \n(01:25:25) Alcohol Tolerance, Dopamine & Serotonin, Pleasure-Pain Balance   \n(01:33:36) Are There Any Positive Effects of Alcohol?, Resveratrol \n(01:35:42) Alcohol & Brain Thickness \n(01:37:11) Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk \n(01:44:31) Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins \n(01:46:54) Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n(01:50:58) Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance\n(01:55:09) Negative Effects of Alcohol Consumption \n(01:58:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "This episode explains how we sense chemicals through smell, taste, and pheromones. How things smell and taste and chemicals in the tears, breath, and on the skin of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do, and our hormones. I explain the 3 types of responses to smell, the 5 types of tastes, the possible existence of sixth taste sense, and how the act of sniffing can make us learn and focus better. I explain how smell and taste reflect brain health and can assess and even promote brain regeneration. I discuss how eating specific categories of foods makes us crave more of those foods, including how to make sour things taste sweet and develop a heightened sense of smell and taste. \nFor the full show notes and timestamps, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, I describe how your brain and body are fundamentally wired to perceive and respond to music and how those responses can be leveraged to improve your mood, allow for processing sad emotions and enhance learning and performance. I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory. Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.

      "description": "This episode, I explain what major depression is at the biological and psychological level and the various treatments that peer-reviewed studies have revealed can help prevent and treat depression. I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Mood Disorders & Maintaining Mental Health (Protocol 1)\n(00:07:25) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:11:15) Major Depression\n(00:18:40) “Anti-Self” Confabulation\n(00:21:42) Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms of Depression\n(00:26:58) Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin\n(00:31:50) SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\n(00:37:00) Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving, Serotonin/Emotions\n(00:39:33) Physical & Emotional Pain are Linked: Substance P\n(00:41:50) Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol \n(00:46:50) Genetic Susceptibility to Depression: Impact of Stress \n(00:50:50) Understanding Biological Mechanism Is Key: Recipes versus Skills\n(00:52:50) Tools for Dealing with Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)\n(00:56:25) Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.\n(00:59:20) Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*\n(01:02:50) How EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine, Quinolinic Acid\n(01:05:25) Protocol 4: How Exercise Offsets Depression \n(01:11:44) Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*\n(01:20:30) Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function\n(01:33:08) Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) for Major Depression: Psilocybin*\n(01:47:00) Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)\n(01:54:50) Summary of Protocols Covered\n(02:00:10) Support & Additional Resources\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Deliberate Cold Exposure, Health Warning\n(00:04:23) Tool: Moderate Exercise & Cognitive Work\n(00:11:04) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:15:37) Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature\n(00:18:41) Tool: Quickly Decrease Core Body Temperature, Glabrous Skin\n(00:25:26) Mental Effects of Cold Exposure\n(00:29:02) Physical Effects of Cold Exposure\n(00:30:11) How Cold Should the Temperature Be?\n(00:34:53) Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion\n(00:38:27) Protocols for Cold Exposure\n(00:50:57) Optimal Mindset(s) During Cold Exposure\n(00:55:26) Tool: Using Movement During Cold Exposure\n(00:57:51) Optimal Frequency of Cold Exposure\n(01:00:22) Cold Exposure for Dopamine, Mood & Focus\n(01:12:55) Cold Exposure & Metabolism, Brown Fat\n(01:25:55) Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure\n(01:29:14) Tools: Increasing Metabolism w/Cold – The Søberg Principle, Shivering\n(01:34:15) Norepinephrine & Fat Cells\n(01:36:22) Cold, Physical Performance, Inflammation\n(01:47:36) Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling\n(01:53:27) Tool: Palmar Cooling & Endurance\n(02:03:18) Cold Exposure to Groin, Increasing Testosterone\n(02:07:50) Tool: Optimal Timing for Daily Cold Exposure\n(02:11:16) Neural Network Newsletter, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify Reviews, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "My guest this episode is Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Professor of Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford University. Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Gut Microbiome\n(00:03:11) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:30) What is the Gut Microbiome?\n(00:12:49) Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability\n(00:16:00) Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets\n(00:21:56) The Human Microbiome Project at Stanford\n(00:26:30) Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations\n(00:28:58) Resilience of the Microbiome\n(00:35:10) Regional Differences Along Your GI Tract\n(00:42:04) Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health\n(00:51:19) Dietary Differences\n(01:01:24) Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods\n(01:07:03) Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners\n(01:12:44) Cleanses: Useful?

      "description": "In this episode, I am joined by Dr. David Sinclair, tenured Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and an expert researcher in the field of longevity. Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022. \nIn this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology. This episode includes lots of basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School\n(00:03:45) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:07:45) “Aging as a Disease” vs. Longevity & Anti-Aging\n(00:10:23) What Causes Aging?

      "description": "In this episode, I discuss the science of gratitude, which has been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction: Gratitude Science & Surprises\n(00:01:50) Controlling Heart Rate with Story\n(00:04:48) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:09:11) Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice\n(00:12:20) Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, & Neural Circuits \n(00:17:50) Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice\n(00:21:22) Neurochemistry & Neural Circuits of Gratitude\n(00:25:10) Prefrontal Cortex Set Context\n(00:30:10) Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables\n(00:34:55) Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks & Story\n(00:42:30) Theory of Mind Is Key\n(00:45:50) Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration\n(00:52:28) Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits \n(00:56:150 You Can’t Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance In Giving\n(00:59:55) How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation\n(01:03:00) 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day \n(01:05:44) Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n(01:07:35) Reducing Inflammation & Fear with Gratitude\n(01:10:56) Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin \n(01:16:00) Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces\n(01:18:50) The Best Gratitude Practices: & How To, My Protocol\n(01:24:25) Subscribe & Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, I explain how the brain engages in creative thinking and, based on that mechanistic understanding, the tools to improve one’s ability to think creatively and innovate in any area. I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Creativity\n(00:04:47) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:51) What is Creativity?\n(00:11:16) Creativity in Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy\n(00:23:37) Neural Circuits of Creativity\n(00:27:54) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:33:13) Creative Ideas & Divergent Thinking\n(00:42:09) Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking\n(00:46:41) Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways\n(00:58:06) Tool: Open Monitoring Meditation & Divergent Thinking\n(01:07:38) Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking\n(01:11:06) Mood, Creativity & Dopamine\n(01:16:00) Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine\n(01:23:41) Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine\n(01:30:15) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest, Mesocortical Dopamine & Divergent Thinking\n(01:43:13) Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking\n(01:49:13) Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis\n(01:52:04) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Creativity\n(01:54:45) Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking\n(02:01:02) Tool: Narratives & Storytelling for Creativity\n(02:14:47) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

Dr. Conti explains specific tools for how to overcome life’s challenges using a framework of self-inquiry that explores all the key elements of self, including defense mechanisms, behaviors, self-awareness and attention. We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful “generative drive” of positive, aspirational pursuits. Dr. Conti also explains how to adjust your internal narratives, reduce self-limiting concepts, overcome intrusive thoughts, and how certain defense mechanisms, such as “acting out” or narcissism, show up in ourselves and others. The next episode in this special series explores how to build healthy relationships with others.\nFor the full show notes, including articles, books, and other resources, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Improve Mental Health\n(00:02:19) Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up App\n(00:05:26) Structure & Function of Healthy Self \n(00:16:25) Agency & Gratitude\n(00:21:14) Aggressive Drive, Pleasure Drive, Generative Drive\n(00:30:00) Physical & Mental Health Similarities, Verb States\n(00:37:05) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:38:32) Lack of Motivation, Drives\n(00:43:06) Video Games/Social Media & Distraction, Generative Drive\n(00:51:46) Asking Better Questions, Psychiatric Medicine, Physical Health Parallels\n(00:59:10) Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n(01:00:30) Self-Reflection & Structure of Self “Cupboards”, Trauma & Agency\n(01:08:53) Feeling Stuck, Defense Mechanisms & Sublimation, Character\n(01:13:58) Self-Reflection & Function of Self “Cupboards”, Self-Awareness\n(01:19:24) Defense Mechanisms & “Acting Out”\n(01:26:43) Salience, Intrusive Thoughts\n(01:31:24) Self-Reflection, Behaviors & Strivings; Roadmap Forward\n(01:38:25) Internal Narratives, Childhood\n(01:44:44) Internal Narratives: Self-Scrutiny & Overcoming; Trauma\n(01:55:18) Time Required for Change, Understanding Intrusive Thoughts\n(02:03:13) Self-Reflection on Internal Drives; Envy\n(02:09:56) Generative Drive; Strong Aggressive Drive & Envy\n(02:21:50) High Aggressive Drive & Social Relationships, Narcissism\n(02:28:43) Narcissism, Destruction, Envy\n(02:37:18) Narcissism & Childhood, Change\n(02:41:26) Engaging with Narcissists, Disengagement\n(02:44:47) Demoralization, Learned Helplessness\n(02:49:34) Self-Inventory of Drives, Optimization\n(02:56:09) Social Media & Salience, Generative Drive\n(03:03:21) Rational Aspiration\n(03:13:16) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "This episode I am joined by Dr. Craig Heller, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and world expert on the science of temperature regulation. We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how most everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster, as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs!

      "description": "In this episode, my guest is Robert Malenka, MD, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine who has made numerous seminal discoveries of how the brain changes (neuroplasticity) in response to learning and in response to rewarding and reinforcing experiences. We discuss the brain’s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Robert Malenka\n(00:02:37) Sponsors: ROKA & Levels\n(00:05:21) Dopamine & Reward Circuitry\n(00:11:31) Reward, Arousal, Memory & Dopamine \n(00:17:34) Context, Cues & Dopamine Modification\n(00:25:38) Memory & Reward Scaling\n(00:30:50) Dopamine, “Addictive Liability” & Route of Administration \n(00:39:07) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:40:04) Drugs of Abuse & Brain Changes; Addiction & Individual Variability\n(00:50:51) Reinforcement vs. Reward, Wanting vs. Liking\n(00:57:500 Opioids, Psychostimulants & Dopamine\n(01:03:38) Sponsor: LMNT\n(01:04:51) Self-Doubt, Confidence & Career\n(01:12:40) Autism Spectrum Disorder\n(01:19:29) Pro-Social Interaction & Reward; Oxytocin, Serotonin & Dopamine\n(01:30:30) Nucleus Accumbens & Behavior Probability\n(01:38:28) Reward for Pro-Social Behavior\n(01:43:13) Social Media & “Addictive Liability”; Gambling\n(01:52:17) Pain, Social Behavior & Empathy\n(02:02:19) Empathy Circuitry, Dopamine & Serotonin \n(02:10:07) Autism Spectrum Disorder & Social Interactions, Empathy\n(02:17:23) MDMA, Serotonin & Dopamine; Addiction & Pro-Social Effects\n(02:28:13) Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Behavior, MDMA & Pharmacology\n(02:37:18) Serotonin, MDMA & Psychedelics \n(02:40:16) Psychedelics: Research & Therapeutic Potential\n(02:47:57) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "In this episode, I explain how dopamine dynamics — meaning changes and interactions between our baseline and peak levels of dopamine drive our cravings and sense of motivation. I also explain how to leverage dopamine dynamics to overcome procrastination. I cover behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools to optimize baseline and peak dopamine levels to ensure a persistently motivated state. I also discuss how to boost motivation when you are in a rut, why you might not want to stack behaviors/substances that spike dopamine and how to build and maintain a “growth mindset” for pursuing goals of any kind. Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dopamine\n(00:02:48) Sponsors: LMNT & Waking Up\n(00:06:27) Dopamine Brain Circuits\n(00:14:53) Goals & Addiction\n(00:17:13) Dopamine Dynamics, “Wave Pool” analogy\n(00:20:28) Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error\n(00:24:46) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:29:40) Feedback Cues & Reward Contingent Learning, “Scoreboard”\n(00:37:40) Addiction; Pleasure & Pain Imbalance\n(00:44:55) Dopamine Release & Addictive Substances/Behaviors\n(00:50:43) Addiction Recovery, Binding Behaviors\n(00:53:25) Tools: Maintain Baseline Dopamine Levels\n(01:03:26) Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n(01:09:38) Prescriptions & Supplementation: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n(01:18:58) Dopamine Trough Recovery, Postpartum Depression\n(01:23:31) Dopamine Dynamics, “Dopamine Stacking”; Intrinsic Motivation\n(01:38:10) Making Effort the Reward, Growth Mindset\n(01:41:49) Tool: Overcome Procrastination\n(01:52:16) Tool: Meditation & Procrastination\n(01:57:01) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
