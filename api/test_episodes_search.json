Join us as we navigate the fascinating world of psychedelic research and its transformative impact on mental health.\n\nHuberman, a renowned neuroscientist, guides us through the science behind Psilocybin's ability to rewire our brain and create profound shifts in consciousness. He shares insights into the mechanisms by which Psilocybin acts on our neural pathways, leading to enhanced emotional well-being, increased creativity, and expanded perspectives.\n\nThroughout the episode, Huberman sheds light on the therapeutic applications of Psilocybin, from its potential in treating anxiety, depression, and addiction to its ability to facilitate personal growth and spiritual experiences. He also discusses the importance of responsible use, the potential risks involved, and the need for proper guidance and integration in psychedelic experiences.\n\nJoin us on this transformative journey as we uncover the cutting-edge research and explore the potential of Psilocybin to revolutionize mental health treatment. Get ready to challenge preconceptions, expand your understanding, and discover the profound impact that this powerful compound can have on our brains and lives.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/7FKSmPIZBNbSgto4eWaz2m?si=c2d5942ca0684d25 - The Full original Podcast Episode Link (Huberman Lab) Websites mentioned in this podcast:\n\nhubermanlab.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport this show and give love to our sponsor below:\n\nBurly Brandz Use the code fast15 - to get 15% off | www.burlybrandz.com/ \n\nConnect with Zach:\n\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/zachnx/\n\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/zach.nx\n\n\n\nConnect with Noah:\n\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/noah.reeves96/\n\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/noah.reeves\n\n\n\nSubscribe to The Big Chew Podcast\n\nInstagram | the.big.chew.podcast \n\nhttps://instagram.com/the.big.chew.podcast?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA== \n\niTunes | https://apple.co/3itxCF8\n\nApple Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-big-chew/id1608218162\n\nSpotify | https://open.spotify.com/show/4hsYkpfaJdBCYa8qmTmNq3?si=N11NYCPcT8qM-E3oLQ3-jA \n\nStitcher | https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/fast-informative-15\n\nAmazon Music | https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/5cfa6001-9e47-4818-917f-a25b2a8ed942/fast-informative-15\n\nGoogle Play Music | https://bit.ly/3upNluj\n\nPodcast Addict | https://www.podcastaddict.com/podcast/3838732\n\n\n\n\n#psilocybin #brainrewiring #therapeuticbenefits #mentalhealth #neuroscience #psychedelicresearch #consciousness #emotionalwellbeing #creativity #personalgrowth #spiritualexperiences #responsibleuse #integration #podcast #newepisode #radioshow #spotifypodcast #applepodcasts #podcast #podcasting #entrepreneur #podcastlife #podcasts #podcaster #hubermanlab #spotifyforpodcasters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/bigchew/message",

Dr. Balcetis’ research focuses on how our perception of the world, particularly our visual perceptions, influences our level and persistence of motivation, how we conceptualize goals, actual goal achievement, and our emotional state as we pursue goals. Dr. Balcetis explains how to best visualize and overcome challenges in pursuit of larger, complex goals. We also discuss the science of how to define goals and intermediate milestones, overcome obstacles, and effectively track progress. This episode highlights science-based, immediately actionable tools that anyone can use to set and achieve physical and/or cognitive goals more effectively.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Emily Balcetis, Visualization of Goals & Motivation\n(00:03:41) Sponsors: LMNT\n(00:08:08) Vision & Motivation\n(00:11:37) Tool: Narrowing Visual Focus & Improving Exercise\n(00:21:39) Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue\n(00:25:14) Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”\n(00:27:57) Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight to Increase Effort\n(00:32:23) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:35:00) Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists \n(00:41:28) Tool: How to Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles\n(00:46:38) Vision is Unique, Challenging the Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-Goals\n(00:57:12) Do Fit People View the World Differently?, States of Body & Visual Experiences\n(01:05:54) Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation\n(01:10:13) Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection\n(01:21:54) Year in Review & Memory\n(01:26:32) Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming\n(01:31:33) Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution\n(01:36:12) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Momentous Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one’s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance.\nFor recommended water filters, tests and the full show notes, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Water\n(00:03:33) Tool Deliberate Cold Exposure, Immersion & Showers Mood & Fat Loss\n(00:15:42) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:19:27) Water: Physical Properties & Chemistry\n(00:26:32) Bonds & Water Phases, “Structured Water”\n(00:32:38) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:07) Body, Cells & Water\n(00:37:37) Water as a Solvent, Temperature & pH\n(00:41:49) Water Transport in Cells, Aquaporin Channels\n(00:49:46) Alkaline/pH Water; Temperature, pH & Water Transport\n(00:55:14) Water Cellular Function, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) & Antioxidants\n(01:02:38) Tool: Baseline Hydration\n(01:11:35) Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation\n(01:15:40) Tool: Hydration, Sauna, Humidity & Sweat; Thirst, Caffeine\n(01:19:15) Hydration; Cognitive & Physical Performance \n(01:23:53) Tool: Water Filtration; Nighttime Urination\n(01:29:35) Tap Water Tests, Disinfection Byproducts (DBPs), Fluoride & Thyroid Health\n(01:37:18) Tool: Water Filters\n(01:44:18) Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment\n(01:48:13) Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health\n(01:53:40) Water Temperature\n(01:56:42) Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched\n(02:03:26) Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration\n(02:11:13) Tool: Molecular Hydrogen Tablets, Water pH\n(02:14:05) Structured Water\n(02:16:39) Tool: Water Pipes, Faucet Filter\n(02:19:42) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin.

      "description": "In this episode, I explain how nicotine impacts the brain and body, including its potent ability to enhance attention, focus, and alertness, increase blood pressure and metabolism and reduce appetite. I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.). As nicotine is one of the most widely used substances with billions of users — most of whom report wanting to quit — this episode ought to be of interest to former/current nicotine users, those who want to quit smoking or vaping and/or those interested in learning the biology behind how nicotine impacts the brain and body.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Nicotine\n(00:03:41) Tool: Brief Daily Meditation & Focus\n(00:05:59) The Arrow Model of Focus, Alpha GPC & Garlic Supplements\n(00:10:05) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:14:35) Nicotine Effects vs. Methods of Delivery, Acetylcholine\n(00:19:55) Where is Nicotine Found?

First, we discuss a paper on how bright light exposure at sunrise and throughout the day and dark exposure at night independently improve mental health and can offset some of the major symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Then, we discuss an article that explores a novel class of immunotherapy treatments to combat cancer. We also discuss some of the new data on low-calorie sweeteners and if they are safe.

I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep.

      "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Berson, Professor & Chairman of Neuroscience at Brown University. Dr. Berson discovered the neurons in your eye that set your biological rhythms for sleep, wakefulness, mood and appetite. He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves. \nHere Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining: how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see, and remember. Also, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind, and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats. \nWe discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system—one that, in just less than two hours, will teach you an entire course's worth about the brain and how yours works.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. David Berson \n(00:03:11) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:02) How We See \n(00:10:02) Color Vision \n(00:13:47) “Strange” Vision\n(00:16:56) How You Orient In Time\n(00:25:45) Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers\n(00:34:45) Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight \n(00:36:20) Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image\n(00:41:03) Sense of Balance\n(00:50:43) Why Pigeons Bob Their Heads, Motion Sickness \n(01:00:03) Popping Ears\n(01:02:35) Midbrain & Blindsight \n(01:10:44) Why Tilted Motion Feels Good \n(01:13:24) Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions\n(01:16:35) Basal Ganglia & the “2 Marshmallow Test”\n(01:24:40) Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex \n(01:33:33) Neuroplasticity \n(01:36:27) What is a Connectome?\n(01:45:20) How to Learn (More About the Brain)\n(01:49:04) Book Suggestion, my Berson Appreciation\n(01:50:20) Zero-Cost ways to Support the HLP, Guest Suggestions, Sponsors, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "This episode I describe the neural mechanisms that activate and control aggressive states and behaviors and the role of hormones—estrogen and testosterone—in mediating violent and and/or competive aggression. I also describe tools that can be used to modulate the factors that have been shown to ‘prime’ an individual for aggression, including sunlight, estrogen sensitivity, competition within social settings, and overall stress levels, and the hormone cortisol. I discuss how substances such as caffeine and alcohol can impact impulsive behaviors, and how nutrition and supplementation can be used to regulate mood and aggression. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Aggression, Types of Aggression\n(00:03:51) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:29) Neural Circuits for Aggression, “Hydraulic Pressure Model” \n(00:15:50) Brain Regions Controlling Aggression, Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH) \n(00:22:14) Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression \n(00:23:36) Stimulation of the VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression\n(00:31:57) Neural Circuits Mediating Physical Acts of Aggression, Biting\n(0:35:56) Testosterone & Competitiveness/Estrogen & Aggression \n(00:43:00) Sunlight, Melatonin & Aggression \n(00:45:46) Cortisol, Serotonin & Aggressive Behaviors \n(00:51:56) Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation & Mood \n(00:54:18) Tool: Sunlight, Sauna & Cortisol Reduction\n(00:55:54) Tool: Ashwagandha & Cortisol Reduction\n(00:57:06) Tool: Seasonality/Sunlight, Genetic Variation in Estrogen Sensitivity\n(01:00:37) Testosterone & Aggression, Competitive Work Environments\n(01:05:07) Testosterone, Amygdala, Challenge & Effort \n(01:09:27) Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity \n(01:13:15) Tool: Caffeinated Alcohol Beverages, Impulsivity & Aggression \n(01:17:18) Tool: ADHD, Acetyl-L Carnitine & Aggressive Behavior \n(01:24:10) Factors Affecting the “Hydraulic Pressure Model” of Aggression \n(01:25:44) Book by Dr. David Anderson, Aggression & Social Relationships \n(01:27:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "Of course, parents want to shower their kids with praise, highlighting their intelligence, talent, and athletic prowess. However, research suggests that simply labeling children as gifted and talented may not be the most effective approach. In fact, certain types of praise can inadvertently hinder a child's performance. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine and host of the Huberman Lab podcast, explores the intricate connection between performance, grit, and the praise we receive and give ourselves. He also delves into the concept of a growth mindset and whether it can be learned and adopted. \"It turns out that the kind of praise or feedback that we receive that attaches our identity to performance can actually undermine our performance,\" Huberman explains in the podcast episode focused on enhancing performance. From a young age, we often internalize beliefs about our strengths and weaknesses, Huberman notes. For instance, I've consistently told myself (and continue to do so) that I'm terrible at drawing—I could never create a proportional figure in art class. Conversely, I used to tell myself (but no longer do) that I was skilled at playing the piano, learning covers of popular songs in my spare time. \"We tend to decide if we are good or bad at things, and we tend to integrate those beliefs with our identity to varying degrees, depending on whether we're professionals, amateurs, or how much we engage in an activity,\" Huberman says. Interestingly, being praised for our talent or intelligence in a specific area can actually limit our potential. As cliché as it may sound, emphasizing and commending the journey rather than the destination is the key to optimizing our performance. As renowned author Glennon Doyle's podcast title suggests, we can indeed do hard things. \nHow to praise your child the 'right' way Huberman references the work of Carol Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford University and author of \"Mindset: How You Can Fulfill Your Potential.\" Dweck's 1998 research laid the groundwork for understanding the importance of effort-based praise over intelligence-based praise in improving performance. Children who were told they were great or smart after completing a task tended to gravitate toward easier activities that bolstered their sense of achievement. \"They are likely to go with the least amount of challenge so that they can continue to receive that praise or feedback,\" Huberman explains. On the other hand, children who were praised for their effort and the process of diligently working on a problem were more inclined to seek out increasingly challenging tasks. Moreover, those praised for their effort actively sought out more challenges in general, aiming to capitalize on and enhance their effort. Paradoxically, telling someone they are a great athlete may lead them to play conservatively, as being good is tied to their identity, and they fear the consequences of losing. \"If you're a parent or teacher, you have to be very careful about giving feedback to a child that is attached to their identity around an endeavor, especially if they're performing well at that endeavor,\" Huberman cautions. Praise with verbs Huberman breaks it down into simple terms: ditch the nouns. \"If you attach effort verbs to why you got good at something, as well as why you are not good at something, then there's only room for improvement,\" he states in the episode. \nTeach a growth mindset Emphasizing effort aligns with adopting a growth mindset—the belief that we can continuously find new ways to optimize performance and tackle challenges. Our identities are not fixed, Huberman asserts. \"Growth mindset is really a way of connecting motivation to cognition,\" Huberman says, adding that it helps individuals bounce back from setbacks and transform frustration into action. As simple as it may seem, clearly outlining the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset is an...",

Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors — either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional. The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.\nFor the full show notes, including articles, books, and other resources, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Paul Conti\n(00:03:46) Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up App\n(00:06:55) What is a Healthy Self?\n(00:10:41) Agency & Gratitude; Empowerment & Humility \n(00:16:13) Physical Health & Mental Health Parallels\n(00:20:21) Structure of Self; Unconscious vs. Conscious Mind; “Iceberg”\n(00:26:15) Defense Mechanisms; Character Structure “Nest”, Sense of Self \n(00:31:27) Predispositions & Character Structure\n(00:36:01) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:37:27) Character Structure & Action States; Physical Health Parallels\n(00:46:20) Anxiety; Understanding Excessive Anxiety\n(00:53:12) Improving Confidence: State Dependence & Phenomenology; Narcissism\n(00:59:44) Changing Beliefs & Internal Narratives\n(01:06:04) Individuality & Addressing Mental Health Challenges\n(01:11:21) Mental Health Goals & Growth\n(01:17:32) Function of Self\n(01:23:00) Defense Mechanisms: Projection, Displacement\n(01:30:14) Projection, Displacement, Projective Identification\n(01:34:50) Humor, Sarcasm, Cynicism\n(01:40:41) Attention & Salience; Negative Internal Dialogue \n(01:45:02) Repetition Compulsion & Defense Mechanism, Trauma\n(01:58:55) Mirror Meditation & Self Awareness; Structure & Function of Self, “Cupboards”\n(02:04:57) Pillars of the Mind, Agency & Gratitude, Happiness\n(02:13:53) Generative Drive, Aggressive & Pleasure Drives\n(02:21:33) Peace, Contentment & Delight, Generative Drive; Amplification\n(02:24:18) Generative Drive, Amplification & Overcoming\n(02:33:00) Over-Thinking, Procrastination, Choices\n(02:42:20) Aggressive, Pleasure & Generative Drives, Envy\n(02:49:46) Envy, Destruction, Mass Shootings\n(02:55:38) Demoralization, Isolation, Low Aggressive Drive\n(03:02:50) Demoralization, Affiliate Defense \n(03:09:32) Strong Aggressive Drive, Competition, Generative Drive Reframing \n(03:20:02) Cultivating a Generative Drive, Spirited Inquiry of the “Cupboards”\n(03:26:06) Current Mental Health Care & Medications\n(03:35:33) Role of Medicine in Exploration\n(03:40:41) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Suzuki shares the mechanisms by which these practices change our brain in order to improve cognitive function fast and reduce age-related cognitive decline.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Wendy Suzuki, Learning & Memory\n(00:03:02) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:07:27) How Memories Form \n(00:10:14) Hippocampus: Memory, Association & Imagination \n(00:16:20) Encoding Long-Term Memory\n(00:18:48) One-Trial Memory\n(00:21:56) Tool: Foundational Habits to Enhance Brain Performance \n(00:30:39) Exercise & Improved Memory, Making a “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus” \n(00:39:35) Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) \n(00:48:48) Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) in Adults\n(00:51:50) Effects of Exercise on Memory \n(00:56:31) Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol \n(01:00:02) Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise \n(01:05:33) Tool: Exercise Protocol for Improving Cognition \n(01:12:17) Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors  \n(01:17:09) “Every Drop of Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function \n(01:20:58) Positive Affirmations & Mood \n(01:27:28) Meditation & Cognitive Performance \n(01:32:27) How Meditation Works, Focusing on the Present\n(01:37:14) Tool: Strategies to Increase Attention \n(01:42:50) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Attia is host of the health and medicine podcast, The Drive, and the author of a new book, “Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity,” which examines disease prevention and healthy aging, including emotional health. He explains the leading causes of death worldwide and how to measure one’s risk of death and mitigate each risk factor. Dr. Attia shares how, in addition to blood-based markers of lipids and hormones, there are behavioral measures and interventions, and key aspects of emotional health (i.e., relationships, emotional stability, purpose, etc.) that fundamentally impact our physical health and longevity, and how to assess and adjust our emotional health. This episode is rich with actionable information related to disease screening and biomarker testing, nutritional, exercise, behavior and prescription-based tools that area useful to all people regardless of age, male or female, and that can significantly improve vitality, health and lifespan.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman  \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Peter Attia\n(00:03:39) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:34) Lifespan vs. Healthspan\n(00:10:54) “4 Horseman of Death”, Diseases of Atherosclerosis\n(00:14:44) Tool: Hypertension & Stroke, Blood Pressure Testing \n(00:23:14) Preventing Atherosclerosis, Smoking & Vaping, Pollution\n(00:28:33) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:33:29) Cholesterol, ApoB\n(00:42:21) Cholesterol Levels, LDL & ApoB Testing\n(00:49:29) ApoB Levels & Atherosclerosis, Causality\n(01:01:06) ApoB Reduction, Insulin Resistance, Statins, Ezetimibe, PCSK9 Inhibitors\n(01:12:30) Monitoring ApoB\n(01:18:30) Reducing Blood Pressure, Exercise & Sleep\n(01:20:50) High Blood Pressure & Kidneys\n(01:23:11) Alcohol, Sleep & Disease Risk\n(01:31:21) Cancer & Cancer Risks: Genetics, Smoking & Obesity\n(01:39:47) Cancer Screening & Survival\n(01:44:17) Radiation Risks, CT & PET Scans\n(01:48:48) Environmental Carcinogens\n(01:52:11) Genetic & Whole-Body MRI Screening, Colonoscopy\n(01:58:47) Neurodegenerative Diseases, Alzheimer’s Disease, ApoE\n(02:08:08) Alzheimer’s Disease & Amyloid\n(02:13:58) Interventions for Brain Health, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n(02:21:26) Accidental Death, “Deaths of Despair”, Fentanyl Crisis\n(02:31:20) Fall Risk & Stability, 4 Pillars of Strength Training\n(02:41:05) Emotional Health\n(02:53:45) Mortality & Preserving Relationship Quality\n(03:02:20) Relationships vs. Outcomes, Deconstructing Emotions\n(03:09:34) Treatment Centers, Emotional Processing & Recovery\n(03:16:34) Tool: Inner Monologue & Anger, Redirecting Self-Talk\n(03:27:37) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I review published data on environmental factors shown to powerfully alter hormone pathways in animals and humans and the effects of cannabis, alcohol and cell phones on testes, sperm, ovaries and hormones. I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences.

      "description": "In this episode, I explain the biology, symptoms, causes and types of bipolar disorder (sometimes called bipolar depression). I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.’ I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Bipolar Disorder\n(00:03:42) Tool: Appetite Suppression & GLP-1, Parallel Pathways, Yerba Mate\n(00:9:19) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:14:24) Prevalence & Severity of Bipolar Disorder\n(00:16:30) Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria of Mania\n(00:28:58) Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability\n(00:33:07) Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States\n(00:38:20) Consequences of Bipolar Disorder, Heritability\n(00:46:53) Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder\n(00:51:51) Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts\n(00:53:06) History of Lithium Treatment\n(01:02:44) Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects\n(01:05:05) Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection\n(01:10:10) Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity\n(01:17:11) Neural States & Mania, Parietal Lobe & Limbic System\n(01:22:58) Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium & Ketamine\n(01:36:00) Talk Therapies: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy\n(01:43:18) Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)\n(01:48:01) Psylocibin, Cannabis\n(01:51:50) Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n(02:03:31) Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity & Neuroplasticity\n(02:06:44) Mania, Creativity & Occupations\n(02:15:33) Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis, Neural Circuits & Treatment\n(02:17:45) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

      "description": "My guest this episode is Charles Zuker, Ph.D., Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics and Neuroscience at Columbia University and an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Zuker is the world’s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste, the “gut-brain axis,” the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Charles Zuker & Taste Perception\n(00:03:22) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:35) Sensory Detection vs. Sensory Perception\n(00:11:48) Individual Variations within Perception, Color\n(00:16:20) Perceptions & Behaviors\n(00:20:19) The 5 Taste Modalities\n(00:26:18) Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste\n(00:28:00) Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons for Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor\n(00:30:14) Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception\n(00:34:02) Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors \n(00:39:34) Burning Your Tongue & Perception\n(00:42:54) The “Meaning” of Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence\n(00:51:55) Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior\n(00:56:16) Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion \n(01:01:44) Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes over One’s Lifetime\n(01:09:14) Integration of Odor & Taste, Influence on Behavior & Emotion\n(01:17:26) Sensitization to Taste, Internal State Modulation, Salt\n(01:24:05) Taste & Saliva: The Absence of Taste\n(01:28:10) Sugar & Reward Pleasure Centers; Gut-Brain Axis, Anticipatory Response\n(01:36:23) Vagus Nerve\n(01:43:09) Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis\n(01:52:03) Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite\n(01:54:06) Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis \n(01:57:30) Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes in Behavior\n(02:01:53) Fast vs. Slow Signaling & Reinforcement, Highly Processed Foods \n(02:10:38) Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context\n(02:15:58) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
